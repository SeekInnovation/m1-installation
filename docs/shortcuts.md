Go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> on the left menu, select Keyboard -> on the right menu, select Move focus to next window. You can now change the shortcut to which ever key is on top of Tab in your keyboard to work like intended.

    shift+command+3  for full screen
    shift+command+4  for region
    shift+command+5  for opening screenshot utility for more accurate region selection

You can change where the screenshots are stored by `shift+command+5`->options.
I created a custom directory `screenshots` under my home directory.
